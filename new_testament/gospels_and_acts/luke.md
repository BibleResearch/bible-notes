# Luke


## Authorship and Audience
Before considering the author, it is important to note that Luke is part one of a presentation that continues into what we call the book of Acts (compare Luke 1:1-4 and Acts 1:1). As far as authorship is concerned, "Luke-Acts", as this combination of the two works is often known, was attributed to Luke by early church. Supporting evidence can be found in the book of Acts where the author, seventy seven times, uses the pronoun "we" to refer to himself and Paul (see Acts 16:10–17, 20:5–18, and 27-28:16). Thus, we know that the author of Luke-Acts was with Paul throughout some of his missionary journeys and Luke fits this description as he is mentioned in Paul's letters (Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:11, and Philemon 24) as a constant and faithful companion.

The particular audience of Luke-Acts is "Theophilus" ("θεόφιλος") as mentioned in Luke 1:3 and Acts 1:1. There is much debate as to the identity of "Theophilus", but there is nothing explicitly in the text. For the purpose of this summary, I will not delve into this any further as it enters the realm of conjecture and is not, in my estimation, essential to understanding Luke-Acts.
