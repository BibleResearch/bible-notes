# Matthew


## Authorship and Audience
Based on the unanimous tradition of the early Church leaders, the book of Matthew was written by Matthew.  Matthew, also called "Levi" (possibly a reference to the tribe or a surname), was a tax collector (see Matthew 9:9, Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27) before becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ and later an Apostle.

Matthew records his account of the Gospel primarily for a Jewish audience.  This is evidence by the fact that there are very few explanations of Hebrew words, customs, and places described in the Gospel.  While all of the gospel records make references to the Old Testament, Matthew makes more than any other with 53 direct citations from 25 Old Testament books.


## Date and Context
The order in which the Gospels were written is highly debated.  I am going to make the argument, based largely on the testimony of Eusibius in 300 A.D., that the gospel as recorded by Matthew was the first of the Gospels to be written.  According to Irenaeus, Matthew wrote his book while Peter and Paul were ministering in Rome.  This would place the book around 62 AD.  I believe Matthew was likely written sometime between 40 AD and 65 AD.


## Observations/Notes
  - Matthew may be related to **James the Less** who is described as "the son of Alphaeus" in Matthew 10:3.

  - According to Fox's *Book of Martyrs*, Matthew originally wrote his gospel account in Hebrew which James the Less then translated into Greek.
