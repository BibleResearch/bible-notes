# Mark

## Theme(s)
- **The True Nature of Power.**  The book of Mark, written to an audience living in one of the most powerful nations in human history, demonstrates the true nature of power including its source, its end, and its proper use.  Jesus Christ is powerfully and dramatically presented as the Messiah, and yet we find Christ submitting to the Father's will, even as that leads Him to the cross where He bears the separation from God the Father that we, ourselves, had earned.

- **The True Nature of Discipleship.**  Time and time again, Peter and Mark impress upon their audience what it means to be a disciple, that is a follower, of Jesus Christ.  This is done through Christ's explicit teaching (8:34-*38*) and through numerous good and bad examples that come up throughout the text (for a few examples, consider: 8:27-33, 1:16-20, and 14:50-52).
