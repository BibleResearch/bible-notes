# Acts

## Authorship and Audience

The book of Acts (sometimes called "The Acts of the Apostles") is part two of a two-part presentation of Christ's work (more on this later) that I'll refer to as "Luke-Acts". Acts 1:1 refers to the book of Luke when it says "the first account".

The early church attributed "Luke-Acts" to Luke. Supporting evidence can be found in the book of Acts where the author, seventy seven times, uses the pronoun "we" to refer to himself and Paul (see Acts 16:10–17, 20:5–18, and 27 - 28:16). Thus, we know that the author of Luke-Acts was with Paul throughout some of his missionary journeys and Luke fits this description as he is mentioned in Paul's letters (Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:11, and Philemon 24) as a constant and faithful companion.

As noted in the article on Luke, the particular audience of Luke-Acts is "Theophilus" ("θεόφιλος") as mentioned in Luke 1:3 and Acts 1:1. There is much debate as to the identity of "Theophilus", but I will not delve into that here as it's not critical to understanding the book.

## Date and Historical Context

Acts was certainly written after the book of Luke based on the introduction in Acts 1:1. Luke may have collected content while writing the book of Luke (see Luke 1:1-4), but this book was almost undoubtedly written after the book of Luke. Like Luke, because there are certain events not mentioned in the book, the likely date range on the book is **60 - 62 AD** (see the notes on the book of Luke for more details).

## Theological Themes

In a sentence: Christ is working through His Church to establish a new creation and bring salvation to the remotest parts of the earth.

1. **Christ's identification with and ongoing work through the Church.**

    Right from the start of the book, Acts 1:1 contains the phrase "all that Jesus *began* to do and teach" (emphasis added) referring to the book of Luke. The implication is that Acts is a continuation of this narrative about what Jesus did and taught. After Jesus ascends into heaven, however, Christ's work is through His Church with whom He identifies. This is highlighted by a number of instances in the book where a pivotal shift occurs through Christ's work:

    - Acts 8:26 "an angel *of the Lord* spoke to Philip..." (emphasis added)
        - Philip is prompted to share the Gospel with the Ethiopian eunuch by "an angel of the Lord"
    - Acts 8:39 "the Spirit *of the Lord* snatched Philip away" (emphasis added)
        - Christ is working through the Spirit to greatly expand the reach of the Gospel
    - Acts 9:4: "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting *Me*?" (emphasis added)
        - Christ identifies with His Church such that to persecute the Church is to persecute Christ
    - Acts 16:7 "the Spirit *of Jesus* did not permit them" (emphasis added)
        - Christ is working through the Spirit to guide the spread of the Gospel

    Consistently in the book of Acts, we see that the Gospel is sovereignly guided by:

    1. Hardship and persecution spreading Christians (e.g. Acts 8:2)
    2. Explicit works/revelations from God (e.g. Acts 16:7)

    Some think of the Gospels as primarily relating the work of Jesus Christ and the book of Acts as primarily focussing on the work on the Holy Spirit, but I don't think this is exegetically defensible. The book of Acts is more about Christ's work in and through the Church by means of the Holy Spirit.

2. **The Church as a new Creation**

    As highlighted in the notes on Luke, Christ is set up as a second Adam innaugurating a new creation. Acts continues this theme with creational language surrounding Pentecost. Acts 2 mentions a "violent rushing wind" which is a rare word also used in Genesis 2:7 of the "breath of life".

    Right after this, the Apostles are filled with the Holy Spirit (note the Spirit's presence at creation in Genesis 1:2) and begin speaking unlearned human languages relevant to those in Jerusalem for passover. This is a reversal of Babel in that we see the ability to communicate across language barriers that began at Babel.

3. **The universality of the Gospel call**

    As Christ is leaving His Church, He sets the expectation that "you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth" (Acts 1:8 - echoing Isaiah 49:6). This continues the theme from the book of Luke that "Christ Came to Save ALL Men" by giving it a geographic dimension. The Gospel of Christ is for *everyone* in all places... the implications of this are wrestled with and worked out throughout the book of Acts as the Gospel follows the expansion that Christ described in Acts 1:8.

## Outline

I'm choosing to break this book down geographically. There are other ways to break it down, but I think this structure best aligns with the actual expansion of the Gospel throughout the book and the expectations set in Acts 1:8.

    l. Acts 21:17 - 28:31 - Paul Persecuted and Sent to Rome

## Observations/Notes

- Interesting the Luke portrays Christ as a second Adam and Acts looks at Adam's formation of His Church (like the creation account in which Adam was made and then given a wife)

### Acts 1

  - Acts 1:3 - What is meant here by "the kingdom of God"?
  - Acts 1:5-6 - When the disciples hear Jesus's statement in vs. 5, they must be thinking of passages like Joel 2 (specially Joel 2:28-32), Zechariah 12-13, and Isaiah 44 (specifically Isaiah 44:3) where the coming of the Spirit is related to the coming of God's kingdom and the later days. This is why the disciples ask their question about the coming of the kingdom in vs. 6.
  - Acts 1:7-8 establishes the Apostles's (and the church's) goal of testifying to Christ. Acts 2 is an example of this testimony (specifically Acts 2:22-24 and Acts 2:29-36) as Peter preaches before the crowds at Pentecost.
  - Acts 1:8 - Based on this verse, we may ask the question: "To what are the Apostles (and the church) testifying?". The answer is the resurrection (and subsequent reign) of Christ. This is evidenced in Acts 2:22-24, 2:32, 3:15, 4:10, 4:33, 5:30-32, 7:55-56, 10:41, 13:31, Acts 17:31, and others.
  - Acts 1:8 - In this verse, the church is established as the institution through which God will work in this (i.e. the current) stage of human history. This principle is continually reiterated and reaffirmed throughout the book of Acts as we see God's work through the church (even over and against the ruling authorities).
