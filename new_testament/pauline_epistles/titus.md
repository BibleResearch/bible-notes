# Titus

## Authorship and Audience

This letter was written by the **Apostle Paul** (1:1) to **Titus** (1:4) who was in Crete to help "set in order" the church (1:5).

## Literary Context

Titus is one of three books that make up the "**Pastoral Epistles**" (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus); Paul wrote these letters to **Timothy** and **Titus** who were pastors at **Ephesus** and **Crete** respectively. Titus is very similar in themes to 1 Timothy and it has a couple wonderful presentations of the Gospel in it.

## Theme(s)

- **Living in light of the gospel in every station of life.** Like 1 Timothy, Paul spends a lot of time talking about how believers should live in light of the gospel. For Paul, there is no disconnect between the gospel and our daily lives. Additionally, Paul applies the gospel to people in different stations of life like the old and young, men and women, slave and free-men. This emphasizes the fact that the impact of the gospel is far-reaching and should impact every part of our lives.
- **The dangers of false and distracting teaching.** In two places (1:10-16 and 3:9-11), Paul warns Titus of the dangers of engaging in the talk of "rebellious men" (1:10) and "foolish controversies" (3:9). False teaching is dangerous because it is motivated by a desire for "sordid gain" (1:11) and its teachers are rendered "detestable" and "worthless" (1:16). Paul also warns Titus against what I call 'distracting teaching'. These include the "foolish controversies and genealogies" referenced in 3:9-11. Unlike wholesome, faithful doctrine (see 3:8), these distracting teachings are "unprofitable" and lead to strife and sin.
