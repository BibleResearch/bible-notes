# 2 Timothy

## Authorship and Audience
This letter was written by **Paul** (1:1) to **Timothy** (1:2).

## Date and Context
As Paul was writing this letter from prison (1:16-18; 2:9), it was likely written around **66-67 A.D.** during Paul's second, Roman imprisonment. 

## Theme(s)
- **Be Faithful!**  One of the key themes of this book is an underlying admonition, plea, and charge that Timothy remain faithful. This book answers questions like "*Faithful to what?*", "*Why should I/Timothy be faithful?*", and "*How can I/Timothy be faithful?*" which are all designed to encourage and support Timothy in his faith and teaching.

## Observations/Notes
  - 2 Timothy is more than likely Paul's last letter. Paul is not hopeful of being released from his imprisonment (4:6) and, as such, is:
    1. Joyful in the hope and rewards which await him (4:6-8).
    2. Intent on passing the Gospel on to the next generation (and ensuring they do the same) (2:2-7).
  - When Paul says "last days" in 2 Timothy 3:1, we need to keep in mind that the "last days" began at Pentecost as Peter points out in his sermon (refer to the entirety of Acts 2, specifically Acts 2:16-17). That is to say, we should not be surprised to see "lovers of self, lovers of money" and the like. These have always been and will continue to be all the more until Christ returns and starts His kingdom here on earth.
