# Ephesians

## Authorship and Audience
**Paul** (see 1:1) wrote this book possibly to the Church in **Ephesus** (see 1:1 and one of the notes below that deals with the intended audience of this book).

## Date and Context
This letter, known as a **prison epistle**, was likely written while by Paul while he was imprisoned in **Rome** between **60** and **62 AD**.

## Observations/Notes
  - Some early manuscripts of Ephesians do not include the word "Ephesus" in 1:1 which leads some scholars to say that this letter may have been an 'encyclical' (a work meant to be circulated and passed around).
