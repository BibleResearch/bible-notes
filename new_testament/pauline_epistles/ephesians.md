# Ephesians

## Authorship and Audience
**Paul** (see 1:1) wrote this book possibly to the Church in **Ephesus** (see 1:1 and one of the notes below that deals with the intended audience of this book). Regardless of the exact, geographic location of the audience, it is clear that Paul was writing to **Gentiles**. Numerous times, mostly in the first three chapters, Paul differentiates between the Jews and his audience (see 1:12-13, 2:11, 2:13, 2:19, 3:1).

## Date and Context
This letter, known as a **prison epistle**, was likely written while by Paul while he was imprisoned in **Rome** between **60** and **62 AD**.

## Theme(s)
- **The Church**  One of the primary themes in this book is the **Church**. This first half of the book covers its formation, both from the perspective of God's eternal, global plan in chapter one and God's personal salvation of individuals in chapter two, its purpose, and its composition. The second half of the book addresses the implications of being part of the Church. In other words, how those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ must live now that they are part of the Church. This is a powerful letter both theologically and pragmatically.

## Observations/Notes
  - Some early manuscripts of Ephesians do not include the word "Ephesus" in 1:1 which leads some scholars to say that this letter may have been an 'encyclical' (a work meant to be circulated and passed around from church to church).
