# Philemon

## Authorship and Audience
Written by **Paul** to **Philemon** (vs. 1), a Christian in Colosse, along with Apphia and Archippus (2).

## Date and Context
Philemon was a relatively wealthy man who owned a slave named "**Onesiumus**". It appears from the text that this slave had run away from Philemon and had found Paul, who was imprisoned in Rome. While with Paul in Rome, Onesiumus became a believer (10) and became useful to Paul in his ministry (11 and 13). Paul then sends Onesiumus back to his master in hopes that:

1. The relationship between Philemon and Onesiumus can be mended (10, 15-19).
2. Philemon will send Onesiumus back to help serve Paul in his ministry (12-14, 20).
