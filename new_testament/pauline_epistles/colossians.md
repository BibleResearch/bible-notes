# Colossians


## Theme(s)
- **Christ's Authority Over All Things.** One of the underlying principles throughout the book of Colossians is that Christ has authority over everything. Be it the dominion of darkness (1:13), creation (1:15), the Church (1:18 and 2:19), every rule and authority (2:10 and 15), the "elementary principles of the world" (2:20), or cultural, ethnic, racial, social divisions (3:11 and 4:9), Christ has authority and power over it. Throughout this book, Paul will discuss the implications of Christ's authority as it relates to everything from the worship of angels (2:18) to the everyday life of a Roman family (3:18 - 4:1).
