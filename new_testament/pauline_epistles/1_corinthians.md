# 1 Corinthians


## Authorship and Audience
Per 1 Corinthians 1:1-2 and 16:21, this letter was written by **Paul** to the "church of God which is at Corinth" (1:2a).


## Date and Context
This letter was most likely written around **55 AD**. This is evidenced by the fact that Paul was writing from **Ephesus** (see 1 Corinthians 16:8) where he stayed for three years (see Acts 20:31) likely between 53 to 55/56 AD. I claim Paul wrote 1 Corinthians toward the end of his stay in Ephesus based on 1 Corinthians 16:6 where Paul is making plans to spend the winter in Corinth.

## Observations/Notes
  - Some scholars and commentators suggest that the "Sosthenes" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:1 is the same leader of the synagogue in Corinth who is mentioned in Acts 18:17. While this is certainly possible, I see no positive evidence that this is necessarily the case.

  - When he first came to them, Paul spent eighteen months with the Corinthians (Acts 18:1-17). The letter of 1 Corinthians was written after this initial visit.

  - As evidenced by passages like 7:1, 8:1, and 12:1, Paul was writing this letter partly to confront issues with the Church and partly to respond to some questions the Corinthians had written him about. This gives us some tremendous insight into how the early church operated and how churches today ought to order themselves.
