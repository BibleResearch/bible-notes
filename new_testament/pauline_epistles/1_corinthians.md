# 1 Corinthians


## Authorship and Audience
Per 1 Corinthians 1:1-2 and 16:21, this letter was written by **Paul** to the "church of God which is at Corinth" (1:2a).


## Date and Context
This letter was most likely written around **55 AD**. This is evidenced by the fact that Paul was writing from **Ephesus** (see 1 Corinthians 16:8) where he stayed for three years (see Acts 20:31) likely between 53 to 55/56 AD. I claim Paul wrote 1 Corinthians toward the end of his stay in Ephesus based on 1 Corinthians 16:6 where Paul is making plans to spend the winter in Corinth.

## Observations/Notes
  - Some scholars and commentators suggest that the "Sosthenes" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:1 is the same leader of the synagogue in Corinth who is mentioned in Acts 18:17. While this is certainly possible, I see no positive evidence that this is necessarily the case.

  - When he first came to them, Paul spent eighteen months with the Corinthians (Acts 18:1-17). The letter of 1 Corinthians was written after this initial visit.
