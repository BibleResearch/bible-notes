# 1 Timothy

## Authorship and Audience
This letter was written by the **Apostle Paul** (1:1) to **Timothy** (1:2) who had been left in Ephesus to correct false teaching in the Church (1:3-7).

## Date and Context
The events described in this book do not overlap with any of those mentioned in the book of Acts which leads scholars to believe one of two things. Either Paul did not write the book (and the book was likely not written during Paul's lifetime), or Paul wrote this letter after the events recorded in the book of Acts. I believe the latter view is more likely as Paul himself hints that he will be released from prison in Philippians 1:25-26 and 2:24 as well as Philemon 22. Thus, this letter was likely written after Paul was released from his first, Roman imprisonment around **63-64 AD**.

## Observations/Notes
  - 1 Timothy is one of three books that make up the "**Pastoral Epistles**" (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus) which were written by Paul to **Timothy** and **Titus** who were pastors at **Ephesus** and **Crete** respectively.
  - As noted by many critics of the book, the pastoral epistles contain different language from many of Paul's other letters. Some go so far as to use this as an objection to Pauline authorship, but this is founded in the invalid assumption that an author must (and can only) use the same words and constructs throughout everything he/she writes regardless of the audience and genre of the written work.
