# 1 Thessalonians

## Authorship and Audience
**Paul** to the church in [Thessalonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki) which, at the time this book was written, may have had a population around a couple hundred thousand.

## Date and Context
This letter was more than likely written after Timothy returned to Paul in Corinth after visiting Thessalonica (see 3:2 and Acts 18:5). From Acts 18:12-17, we know that while Paul was in Corinth, he went before the "proconsul of Achaia" named **Gallio** (Acts 18:12) and left shortly there after (Acts 18:18). Based on an inscription known as the "**Delphi Inscription**" or the "Gallio Inscription"<sup>†</sup>, we know that Gallio was the proconsul between 51 and 52 AD. Thus, assuming the first letter to the Thessalonians was written before Paul went before Gallio and left Corinth, it must have also been written before 52 AD. Thus, it is safe to say that this letter was likely written around **50-51 AD**.
