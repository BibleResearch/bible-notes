# James

## Authorship and Audience
The author of this letter is **James** (vs.1), most likely James the half-brother of Jesus (for more details on this, see the observations). This letter was written "to the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad" which I believe to mean **Jews** (likely believers based on the repeated use of "my brethren" throughout the book) who were scattered throughout the Roman empire.

## Date and Context
Assuming the letter was truly written by James, the half-brother of Jesus, it must have been finished before his martyrdom in 62 AD. Also, there is no mention of the Jerusalem Council in this book so it is distinctly possible that this book was written **before the Jerusalem Council** which is described in Acts 15 and likely occurred around 50 AD. Thus, the book may have been written some time **before 50 AD and at latest before 62 AD**. If the book were indeed written before 50 A.D., it is likely chronologically the earliest book from the New Testament to have been written.
