# 2 Peter

## Authorship and Audience

In terms of authorship, this book is among the most widely disputed books in the New Testament. When mentioning the book, Origen (185 - 253) notes that there were some who disputed Petrine authorship of this book. Many modern scholars concur in saying that Peter was not the author of 2 Peter. There is a good discussion of this debate in the "Introduction" section [here](https://bible.org/seriespage/second-peter-introduction-argument-and-outline). I will leave it to you to investigate these claims as there has already been much ink spilled about the subject and I have nothing more to contribute. Personally, I accept Petrine authorship for the reason discussed in the paragraph below.

I want to make one note regarding authorship. Probably the most compelling (and certainly the most common) argument *against* Petrine authorship is the significant difference in the quality and character of the Greek used in 1 Peter versus that of 2 Peter. The logic goes something like: "If the Greek used in 1 Peter and 2 Peter are so different, Peter can't have written them both". My response would be that 1 Peter 5:12 which implies that Silvanus was an [amenuensis](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanuensis) who wrote what Peter dictated. As such, Peter, who may have been more eloquent in speech than in writing, could simply speak the things he wanted to say. Thus, it is possible that Peter authored 1 Peter by dictating to Silvanus and wrote 2 Peter with his own hand.

As to the audience of this book. verse one states that the audience is believers. 2 Peter 3:1 likely refers to 1 Peter, so it is reasonable to assume that the audience of 2 Peter had received or was familiar with 1 Peter (see *Authorship and Audience* section for that book). 2 Peter 3:15 also notes that the audience had received a letter from Paul at one point. Although we don't know of any Pauline letter addressed to believers in the churches mentioned as the audience of 1 Peter, it could be that Paul's letters were passed around to those churches or that Paul had written other letters of which we are not aware.

## Date and Context

The Roman Emperor Nero died in 68 AD. If tradition is correct in claiming that Peter was martyred by Nero, the letter must have been written before or during 68 AD. 2 Peter 1:14 shows that Peter thought his death was imminent which dates the letter **shortly before or during 68 AD at the latest**.
