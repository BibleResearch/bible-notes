# 2 John

## Authorship and Audience
The text refers to the sender as **"the elder"** (vs. 1) and to the recipient as the **"chosen lady and her children"**. Based on the testimony of tradition and the similarities between this letter and 1 John, it is very likely that the author is the **Apostle John**. There is some debate about the identity of this "chosen lady". Some argue she is likely a reference to the church, others argue she was a literal woman. Both of these views are possible so, until proven otherwise, I choose to hold the most simple, literal view that the lady is referring to a literal woman.

## Date and Context
According to tradition, the Apostle John served and died in **Ephesus** toward the later part of his life. It is likely that this letter was written from Ephesus sometime around **90 AD**.
