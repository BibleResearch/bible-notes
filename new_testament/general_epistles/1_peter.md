# 1 Peter

*How to glorify God in the midst of trials.*

## Authorship and Audience
As claimed by the name of the letter and 1 Peter 1:1, the Apostle Peter wrote this book. The primary obejction to this claim is that 1 Peter contains elements of classical Greek which is very different from 2 Peter. This, however, can be easily explained by 1 Peter 5:12 which suggests that Silvanus (see Acts 15:32) was involved in the writing of 1 Peter, likely as an [amenuensis](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanuensis) who could have added the more sophisticated elements of Greek grammar to the letter.

  Based on 1 Peter 1:1, this letter is addressed to believers who were "aliens" in various places throughout modern-day Turkey. These believers were facing persecution (1 Peter 1:6), possibly as a result of Nero blaming Christians for the burning of Rome.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Based on 1 Peter 4:3, the audience of the letter was likely a Gentile audience.

## Date and Historical Context
By tradition, Peter was martyred between 65 and 68 AD. Thus, we can safely assume the letter was written in or before 65 AD. According to [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus), Emperor Nero started a fire in Rome in 64 AD which he blamed on Christians. This began a wave of persecution against Christians which would have lead many to flee Rome and live elsewhere, as described in 1 Peter 1:1. 1 Peter was certainly written before Peter's martyrdom and may have been written after persecution against Christians had begun.

## Literary Context
This is one of two letters we have from the Apostle Peter. Like the other epistles of the New Testament, it describes the work of Christ and its consequences for the recipients of the letter.

## Theological Themes
1. **How to glorify God in the midst of trials and persecutions.** One of the common words in this letter is "glory". It frequently refers to God's, innate glory (1 Peter 1:21, 4:11, 4:13-14, 5:10) and often describes the honor given to God by those who persevere (1:7, 2:9, 2:12, 4:11, 4:13-14). Faithful elders even receive a "crown of glory" (5:4). If God is working for His own glory (see Ephesians 1:3-14 and Exodus 34:14), 1 Peter is a guide on how to bring God glory, even in the midst of suffering and persecutions. This theme is clearly presented in 1 Peter 1:6-7.

## Observations
- The phrase "born again" occurs twice in 1 Peter 1 (1 Peter 1:3 and 1:23). The only other place this phrase occurs in the Bible is John 3.
- 1 Peter 1:22 - 2:3 is reminiscent of James 1:18-*25* in that it describes Christians as having been "born again" (or "brought forth" in James 1:18) by the word of God.
- There are two "entrust" statements in 1 Peter 2:23 and 4:19. The first describes Christ "entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously" and the second encourages those suffering to "entrust their souls to a faithful Creator".
