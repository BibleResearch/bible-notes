# 1 Peter

## Authorship and Audience
As claimed by the name of the letter and 1 Peter 1:1, the Apostle Peter wrote this book. The primary obejction to this claim is that 1 Peter contains elements of classical Greek which is very different from 2 Peter. This, however, can be easily explained by 1 Peter 5:12 which suggests that Silvanus (see Acts 15:32) was involved in the writing of 1 Peter, likely as an [amenuensis](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanuensis) who could have added the more sophisticated elements of Greek grammar to the letter.

  Based on 1 Peter 1:1, this letter is addressed to believers who were "aliens" in various places throughout modern-day Turkey. These believers were facing persecution (1 Peter 1:6), possibly as a result of Nero blaming Christians for the burning of Rome.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Based on 1 Peter 4:3, the audience of the letter was likely a Gentile audience.

## Literary Context
This is one of two letters we have from the Apostle Peter. Like the other epistles of the New Testament, it describes the work of Christ and its consequences for the recipients of the letter.

## Observations
- 1 Peter 1:22 - 2:3 is reminiscent of James 1:18-*25* in that it describes Christians as having been born (or "brought forth" in James 1:18) by the word of God.
