# Hebrews

## Authorship and Audience
The author of the book of Hebrews is not given in the book itself. Our biggest clue, which leads us to, frankly, nothing more than conjecture, is the writing style, structure, and vocabulary used throughout the book. There are many people who have been considered by some to be the authors of this book including Paul, Apollos, and Luke. In truth, it is very hard to identify who it *was* based solely on evidence from the text. Honestly, it doesn't really matter who wrote Hebrews anyway as it has been recognized as being inspired by God Himself.

As far as the audience of the book is concerned, the traditional, Greek title of the work was "To the Hebrews" and, based on the Jewish themes discussed throughout the book, the name has remained to this day.
