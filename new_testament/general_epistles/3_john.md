# 3 John

## Authorship and Audience
According to verse 1, this letter was written by **"the elder"**, likely a reference to the **Apostle John** (see notes on 2 John for more on this). The letter is addressed to a specific person named **Gaius**. This was a common name in Bible times also used in Acts 19:29, 20:4, Romans 16:23, and 1 Corinthians 1:14. I see no indication that the Gaius to whom this book is addressed is the same person mentioned in any of these other passages.

## Date and Context
Like 2 John, this book was likely written late in the Apostle John's life as he served in **Ephesus** around **90 AD**.
