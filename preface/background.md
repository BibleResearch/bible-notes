# Background

Why was this project started?

This project began as a personal study aid. I was reading through the Old Testament and found that I wasn't retaining as much as I would have liked. I found that by writing notes about a text, I understood both the text and its implications better. Thus, I began taking notes on the books I was reading and have kept taking and improving these notes ever since.
