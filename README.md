# Bible Notes

Hello,

My name is Floyd Hightower. This is a project to create a short overview of each book in the Bible. The public version of the project is available at [https://bible.hightower.space/notes/](https://bible.hightower.space/notes/).

If you find this helpful (or otherwise) or have any questions, I would appreciate some feedback. You can contact me [here](mailto:floyd.hightower27@gmail.com). Thanks in advance!

Three important principles to keep in mind:

1. **I am human.** There are unfortunately typos, misinterpretations, misrepresentations, and other errors in this work to which I am blind. These errors come from me and not the Bible. I apologize for them in advanced and will seek to make this project as clear and accurate as is possible. Again, I would appreciate [feedback](mailto:floyd.hightower27@gmail.com) especially if you have a question or notice a mistake.
2. **This is a living document** which will continue to change (hopefully improve) over time.
3. On some of the overviews, I include citations referencing outside resources. **Please understand that a citation is not an endorsement.** By citing another work, I am not endorsing everything that the author(s) has to say. I am only using it to the extent the resource is used in my notes. If you're looking for helpful resources, you can find a list [here](https://bible.hightower.space/resources/).

Thanks for stopping by!

Working for Christ and Scripture,

Floyd Hightower

“Surely there is a mine for silver<br />
And a place where they refine gold.<br />
“Iron is taken from the dust,<br />
And copper is smelted from rock.<br />
“Man puts an end to darkness,<br />
And to the farthest limit he searches out<br />
The rock in gloom and deep shadow.<br />
“He sinks a shaft far from habitation,<br />
Forgotten by the foot;<br />
They hang and swing to and fro far from men.<br />
“The earth, from it comes food,<br />
And underneath it is turned up as fire.<br />
“Its rocks are the source of sapphires,<br />
And its dust contains gold.<br />
“The path no bird of prey knows,<br />
Nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it.<br />
“The proud beasts have not trodden it,<br />
Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.<br />
“He puts his hand on the flint;<br />
He overturns the mountains at the base.<br />
“He hews out channels through the rocks,<br />
And his eye sees anything precious.<br />
“He dams up the streams from flowing,<br />
And what is hidden he brings out to the light.<br />
<br />
“But where can wisdom be found?<br />
And where is the place of understanding?<br />
“Man does not know its value,<br />
Nor is it found in the land of the living.<br />
“The deep says, ‘It is not in me’;<br />
And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’<br />
“Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it,<br />
Nor can silver be weighed as its price.<br />
“It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,<br />
In precious onyx, or sapphire.<br />
“Gold or glass cannot equal it,<br />
Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.<br />
“Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned;<br />
And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.<br />
“The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,<br />
Nor can it be valued in pure gold.<br />
“Where then does wisdom come from?<br />
And where is the place of understanding?<br />
“Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living<br />
And concealed from the birds of the sky.<br />
“Abaddon and Death say,<br />
‘With our ears we have heard a report of it.’<br />
<br />
“God understands its way,<br />
And He knows its place.<br />
“For He looks to the ends of the earth<br />
And sees everything under the heavens.<br />
“When He imparted weight to the wind<br />
And meted out the waters by measure,<br />
When He set a limit for the rain<br />
And a course for the thunderbolt,<br />
Then He saw it and declared it;<br />
He established it and also searched it out.<br />
“And to man He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;<br />
And to depart from evil is understanding.’”<br />

~ Job 28
