# Chronicles

The books we know as 1 and 2 Chronicles were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books are treated as one for the sake of unity. In the notes below, I will refer to 1 and 2 Chronicles simply as "Chronicles".

## Authorship and Audience
Jewish tradition holds that Ezra wrote this book. While some liberal scholars doubt this attribution, the similar themes throughout Chronicles and Ezra seem to indicate that one author/editor was involved.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Given that 1 and 2 Chronicles cover the history of Israel from Adam to exile, the direct audience is Israel.

## Date and Historical Context
Chronicles ends with Cyrus allowing the first group of Israelites to return from exile. This occurred in 538 BC, so the book must have been written after that date. When the author wrote the book, many Israelites had returned from exile to find their land and cities decimated. As they began the rebuilding process, this book would have served as a reminder about what is important.

## Literary Context
Chronicles is fascinating as it starts with Adam and ends with the Babylonian exile. It encompasses the majority of Ancient Israelite history albeit with a very specific focus. Because it covers so much history, Chronicles ties in with many of the books before it and forms the background for most of the prophets who follow. The last two verses in 2 Chronicles are used to start the book of Ezra and Chronicles is not quoted in the New Testament.

## Observations
- While Chronicles does repeat the history found in Samuel and Kings, "over 55 percent of the material in Chronicles is unique" (meaning it is not found in Samuel or Kings).<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>
