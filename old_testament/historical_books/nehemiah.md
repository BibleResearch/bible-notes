# Nehemiah ~ *Yahweh comforts*

## Authorship and Audience
According to both Jewish and Christian traditions, Ezra wrote the book of Nehemiah. This argument is based on similarities between the books of [Ezra](ezra.html) and Nehemiah as well as the fact that the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) and [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) both attribute Ezra and Nehemiah to Ezra. Ezra did, however, use Nehemiah's personal records as a source for the account. This is why portions of the text (1:1 – 7:5, 12:27–43, and 13:4–31) are in the first person. Given the focus on the reconstruction of the temple and reinstitution of the purity described in the law, this book was written to the nation of Israel as she was seeking to reestablish her national identity.

## Date and Historical Context
Based on Nehemiah 1:2, the events described in the book begin in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I's reign (ca 445 BC). The book was written after Nehemiah had served as governor which was probably sometime between **425 and 400 BC**. Some of Israel had returned from Exile and were seeking to rebuild their land and reestablish their national identity.

## Literary Context
The book of Nehemiah continues from Ezra as it describes the third group of people to return from Persia to rebuilt Jerusalem and the temple. It also describes the nascent phases of the Jewish culture that would lead to the political-religious climate of Jesus' day.
