# Kings

The books we know as 1 and 2 Kings were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books will be treated as one for the sake of unity.

## Authorship and Audience
According to Jewish tradition, Jeremiah wrote the books we know as 1 and 2 Kings.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> This is unlikely, however, as the event described in 2 Kings 25:27–30 occurred in Babylon and Jeremiah, if he were still alive, would have been in Egypt at this time (see Jeremiah 43:1–7).<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>. Thus, the author of this book is unknown. Whoever he or she was, the author was clearly writing to a Jewish audience as evidenced by the emphasis on why Israel and Judah went into exile.

## Literary Context
The book of 1 Kings picks up where 2 Samuel leaves off. David is the king of Israel, but is a shadow of his former self. 1 and 2 Kings cover the history between David's reign (ca. **971 BC**) and the exile of the southern kingdom (ca. **561 BC**). The **temple**, which Solomon builds in 1 Kings 5 - 7, plays a critical role in future books (e.g. Ezekiel and Matthew) as the construction of a temple is tied to the coming of the Messiah (see 2 Samuel 7:13). The history described in Kings forms the background for most of the prophets and explains how and why Israel went into exile. Chronicles (the books we know as 1 and 2 Chronicles) will reiterate the history of Israel covered in Samuel and Kings from a different perspective.

## Theological Themes
- **God is the True King.** Throughout the book of Kings, the author goes out of his way to mention the prophecies which were fulfilled (2:27, 12:15, 12:21-24, 13:2-6, 15:28-30, 16:12, 16:34). This demonstrates the fact that God is ultimately in control over the kings of Israel and Judah.
- **The Role of the Temple.** The Temple built by Solomon would have been spectacular to see! The doors and floors were coated in gold (6:30-35) and the inside featured carved cedar (6:18). The walls, doors, columns, and alter were decorated with carvings of gourds, flowers, palm trees, cherubim, and pomegranates (6:18, 6:29, 6:35, 7:18, and 7:24). All of these icons point back to the **Garden of Eden**. The temple is a reminder that Eden is not entirely lost and that there is still hope for restoration.

## Observations
- Solomon is an extremely enigmatic character for many reasons. First, he is very committed to what ever he is doing. When he is building the temple to worship God, he spares no expense; when he is sinning against God, he does it magnificently. He is not the type of person to do something half-heartedly. Second, we don't get to know Solomon personally like we got to know David or Saul. The text does not provide us with any of Solomon's thoughts and the reader doesn't hear Solomon speak outside of a few interactions. While we learn a lot from Solomon's outward actions, "the inner man is missing, the narrative is silent."<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>
- The word "know" is repeated often in the first chapter in reference to David's lack of knowledge (1 Kings 1:4, 1:11, 1:18). David is portrayed as a completely impotent King who can't keep himself warm and doesn't *know* very much.
- There is irony in the fact that Solomon asked for a "hearing" or "listening" heart (1 Kings 3:9), God warns him of the danger of apostasy (9:6-9), but Solomon doesn't listen (or does not care enough) and ends up being drawn away from the true God.

<a id="footnote3">3. </a>The "Law of the Kings" is described in Deuteronomy 17:14-*20*. It prohibits kings from multiplying horses, wives, and gold (all means by which a king would consolidate and solidify his power). It also stipulates that the kings must write a copy of the law which they would read every day to be able to judge with justice. The primary purpose of this law is to make sure that kings were subject to God and His laws and did not become arrogant, trusting in their own power and strength to rule.
