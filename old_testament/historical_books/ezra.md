# Ezra ~ *"God helps"*

In the Hebrew Bible, Ezra and Nehemiah form one book. In this study, Ezra and Nehemiah will be treated separately, but they are best understood in conjunction with one another.

## Authorship and Audience
As the name implies, the book of Ezra has been attributed to a priest and scribe named Ezra. Ezra enters in the scene in Ezra 7 and plays a crucial role through the rest of the book as well as the book of Nehemiah. The direct audience is Israel as this book documents Israel's return from exile as God has promised.

## Date and Historical Context
The book of Ezra starts with a decree from [King Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) (Ezra 1:1-4) around 537/538 BC. Ezra records opposition faced by the reconstruction efforts as the project starts and restarts between 538 and 445 BC. Initially, a man named **Zerubbabel** is leading the reconstruction efforts (Ezra 1 - 6 ~ 538 - 458 BC). Ezra himself returned from Persia to Jerusalem in **458 BC** and would have finished writing the book in the years following this date. The date 458 BC assumes that the "Artaxerxes" referenced in 7:7 is [Artaxerxes I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia) who began to reign in 465 BC. Israel had been in exile for many years and were finally returning to Israel and reinstituting the festivals and laws described in the Mosaic law.

## Literary Context
Ezra 1:1-3a is the same as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. Thus, Ezra begins where 2 Chronicles ends. The book of Ezra details the return of Israel from exile which fulfills God's promises made in earlier books and lays the foundation for the culture into which Jesus Christ enters. Theologically, the theme of Ezra (which is discussed below) demonstrates how the exile fits in God's redemptive plan.

## Theological Theme
- **The exile is not over (spiritually speaking).** While Israel has physically returned from exile, they are not spiritually out of exile. This theme is established by both Ezra and Nehemiah.

## Observations
- Ezra 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 are written in [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language). This is evidence that Ezra had access to official documents from the Persian king which would have been written in Aramaic.
- Ezra 1:1-3a are the same as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. The literary implications of this are discussed [here](#literary-context). From an authorial and historical perspective, this implies that Ezra had access to the book of Chronicles or visa-versa (or, that Ezra is the author of both Chronicles and Ezra).
- Ezra 7:10 is a fantastic model for anyone aspiring to be a teacher. Learn it; live it; teach it.
