# Ezra ~ *"God helps"*

## Authorship and Audience
The book of Ezra, as the name implies, has been attributed to the priest Ezra. Ezra enters in the scene in Ezra 7 and plays a crucial role through the rest of the book as well as the book of Nehemiah. This book was written to Israel as it documents Israel's return from exile as God has promised.

## Date and Historical Context
Ezra returned from Persia to Jerusalem in **458 BC**. This date assumes that the "Artaxerxes" referenced in 7:7 is [Artaxerxes I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia) who began to reign in 465 BC. Israel had been in exile for many years and were finally returning to Israel and reinstituting the festivals and laws described in the Mosaic law.

## Literary Context
Ezra begins with the exact same text as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. Thus, Ezra is a continuation of Chronicles. The book of Ezra details the return of Israel from exile which fulfills God's promises made in earlier books and lays the foundation for the culture into which Jesus Christ enters.

## Observations
- Ezra 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 are written in [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language). This is evidence that Ezra had access to official documents from the Persian king which would have been written in Aramaic.
- Ezra 1:1-3a are the same as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. The literary implications of this are discussed [here](#literary-context). From an authorial and historical perspective, this implies that Ezra had access to the book of Chronicles or visa-versa (or, that Ezra is the author of both Chronicles and Ezra).
- Ezra 7:10 is a fantastic model for anyone aspiring to be a teacher. Learn it; live it; teach it.
