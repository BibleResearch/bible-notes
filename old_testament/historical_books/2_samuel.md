# 2 Samuel

The books we know as First and Second Samuel were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books are treated separately, but this distinction is artificial.

## Literary Context
Second Samuel continues to follow David's rise from the anointed king without a throne, to the king of Judah, to the king of all Israel. Second Samuel establishes the **Davidic Covenant** which elaborates on the nature and role of the 'Messiah' referenced in Genesis 49:8–12, Numbers 24:7–9, and Numbers 24:17–19. This Messiah gets woven into many of the prophetic books after 2 Samuel such as Isaiah (9:1-7), Ezekiel (37:24-*28*), and Hosea (3). In the New Testament, the genealogy in Matthew 1 is primarily designed to show the reader that Christ is from the line of David and is the Messiah (Matthew 1:23).

## Theological Themes

Because 1 and 2 Samuel were originally one book, the themes for [1 Samuel](1_samuel.html#theological-themes) also apply to 2 Samuel. In addition to the themes from 1 Samuel, there are a couple of themes that are specific to 2 Samuel:

- **The Davidic Covenant.** In 2 Samuel 7:8-17, God speaks through Nathan the prophet to reveal His plan and promises for David. These plans and promises are known as the 'Davidic Covenant'. The covenant lays out promises for the future including peace for Israel (10-11), the continuation of David's line (11), and a seed in David's line who will build a temple for God and reign forever (12-13). This covenant is significant because it ties the promises given to **Abraham** (e.g. Genesis 12) and **Judah** (Genesis 49:10-12) into one man (see Luke 1:31-33, 1:54-55, and 1:72-75) who will bring prosperity to reverse the curse on the earth given in Genesis 3:17-19 (Genesis 49:11-12 predicts this reversal). Looking forward in the Bible, the Davidic Covenant helps us understand what the Messiah will accomplish (as elaborated by later prophets and the book of Revelation).
- **The Nature and Effects of Sin.** Possibly more than any book before 2 Samuel, we get a graphic display of the effects of sin and its true nature. One scholar describes 2 Samuel 10-20 with the words "Sin and Punishment".<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> The entire narrative swings from David's successful, victorious reign (chapters 1 - 9) to one of tumult and chaos (chapters 10 - 20) as we see the devastating **effects of sin**. Sin is destructive and nowhere in the Bible is this more clear than 2 Samuel (see 2 Samuel 12:10-12).
  
  Nathan's confrontation of David (2 Samuel 12:1-14) and David's confession (2 Samuel 12:13 and Psalm 51), remind us of the true **nature of sin**. Sin is **despising God and His word** (2 Samuel 12:9-10, 12:13, and Psalm 51:4). When we know something is wrong and still do it, this is not only disobedience of an external, objective morality; it is a demonstration that we *[despise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/despise)* God and His word.
