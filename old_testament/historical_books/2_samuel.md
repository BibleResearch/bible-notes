# 2 Samuel

The books we know as First and Second Samuel were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books are treated as separate, but remember that this distinction is artificial.

## Literary Context
Second Samuel continues to follow David's rise from the anointed king without a throne, to the king of Judah, to the king of all Israel. Second Samuel establishes the **Davidic Covenant** which elaborates on the nature and role of the 'Messiah' referenced in Genesis 49:8–12, Numbers 24:7–9, and Numbers 24:17–19. This Messiah gets woven into many of the prophetic books after 2 Samuel such as Isaiah (9:1-7), Ezekiel (37:24-*28*), and Hosea (3). The genealogy in Matthew 1 is primarily designed to show the reader that Christ is from the line of David and is the Messiah (Matthew 1:23).

## Theological Theme
- **The Nature and Effects of Sin.** Possibly more than any book before 2 Samuel, we get a graphic display of the true nature of sin and its effects. The entire narrative switches from David's successful, peaceful reign to one of tumult and chaos because of David's sin with Bathsheba (12:10-11). In Nathan's confrontation of David (2 Samuel 12:1-14) and David's confession (Psalm 51), we are reminded that the true nature of sin is despising God and His word (2 Samuel 12:9-10 and Psalm 51:4).
