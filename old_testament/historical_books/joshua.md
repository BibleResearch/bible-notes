# Joshua

## Authorship and Audience
The author is not mentioned in the text. Based on Joshua 6:25, we do know that Rahab was still alive when the book was written, so it is likely that the author is someone from the narrative; Joshua or Phineas are possible candidates, but we are not certain. The book was written to Israel as would have served as a record of what God had done on their behalf.

## Date and Historical Context
Given that this book was written while Rahab was still alive (Joshua 6:25), it was likely written between **1405 and 1370 BC**.

## Literary Context
The book of Joshua picks up where Deuteronomy left off with the people of Israel opposite the Jordan from the promised land, Moses dead, and Joshua now leading Israel. It describes how Israel enters and takes the promised land and, thus, serves as the foundation for the following books which described Israel's history while in the promised land. Some seemingly minor details mentioned in the book of Joshua become significant in later books (e.g. Rahab (Joshua 2 and Matthew 1:5); the destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6:26 and 1 Kings 16:34)).

## Outline

**0. Crossing the Jordan [1 - 5:12]**

**I. Taking the Promised Land [5:13 - 12]**

**II. Dividing the Promised Land [13 - 21]**

**III. Serving Yahweh and Him Alone [22 - *24*]**

## Theological Theme
- **God Fights for Israel.** Throughout the book of Joshua, God is the one fighting for Israel. Consider the miraculous, albeit unconventional, victory at Jericho in Joshua 6. In Joshua 10:6-14, God rains giant stones from the sky on Israel's fleeing enemies and listens to Joshua's request that the sun stand in the sky. God not only promises that Israel will take the land, but He also helps them conquer the land by fighting for them (10:42).
- **Theology of Rest.** The book of Joshua does much to establish the theology of rest which is used in Hebrews 4 to encourage believers to persevere and enter the rest of salvation.
- **God's Covenant Faithfulness.** The book of Joshua screams of God's faithfulness. Around six hundred years before Israel entered the promised land, God promised Abraham that his descendants would own this land (Genesis 12:7). God also allows Israel to be enslaved as He promised (Genesis 15:12-16), brings Israel out of Egypt with many possessions as He promised (Genesis 15:12-16 and Genesis 50:24), and punishes the Egyptians (Genesis 15:12-16). God is fulfilling many of His promises as the author writes in Joshua 21:43-45:

  > "Not one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass."

## Observations/Notes
- Joshua's final statement to the nation of Israel in Joshua 24:14-28, is fascinating in that he says that Israel "will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God". Joshua is well acquainted with the pervasive sinfulness of Israel and recognizes that this will prevent them from ever being able to serve God.
- Rahab is in the geneology of Christ (Matthew 1:5)
