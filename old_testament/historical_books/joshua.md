# Joshua

## Literary Context
The book of Joshua picks up where Deuteronomy left off with the people of Israel opposite the Jordan from the promised land, Moses dead, and Joshua now leading Israel. It describes how Israel enters and takes the promised land and, thus, serves as the foundation for the following books which described Israel's history while in the promised land. Some seemingly minor details mentioned in the book of Joshua become significant in later books (e.g. Rahab (see Joshua 2 and Matthew 1:5); the destruction of Jericho (see Joshua 6:26 and 1 Kings 16:34)).

## Outline

**0. Cross [1 - 5:12]**

**I. Take [5:13 - 12]**

**II. Divide [13 - 21]**

**III. Serve [22 - *24*]**

## Theological Theme
- **God Fights for Israel.** Throughout the book of Joshua, God is the one fighting for Israel. Consider the miraculous, albeit unconventional, victory at Jericho in Joshua 6. In Joshua 10:6-14, God rains giant stones from the sky on Israel's fleeing enemies and listens to Joshua's request that the sun stand in the sky. God not only promises that Israel will take the land, but He also helps them conquer the land by fighting for them (see 10:42).
- **Theology of Rest.** The book of Joshua does much to establish the theology of rest which is used in Hebrews 4 to encourage believers to persevere and enter the rest of salvation.

## Observations/Notes
- Rahab is in the geneology of Christ (see Matthew 1:5)
