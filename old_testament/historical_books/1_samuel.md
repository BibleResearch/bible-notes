# 1 Samuel

Before starting, it is important to recognize that the books we know as First and Second Samuel were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books will be treated as separate, but it is important to keep in mind that this distinction is artificial.

## Authorship and Audience
According to Jewish tradition, Samuel wrote First Samuel chapters one through twenty four while Gad and Nathan finished the rest of First Samuel and all of Second Samuel.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> The primary difficulty with this claim is that 1 Samuel 27:6 implies that the author (or editor) was writing during the time of the divided monarch. Thus, First and Second Samuel could not have been written in their final forms by Samuel, Nathan, or Gad because none of them lived during the time of the divided monarchy. It is certainly possible that the books we know as First and Second Samuel incorporated writings and accounts from Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, but the author remains unknown to us.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

## Date and Historical Context
Assuming this book was written during the time of the divided monarchy, it was probably written ca. **931â€“722 BC**.<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>

## Literary Context
The book of Samuel continues from Judges as the first, main character (Samuel) is a judge (see 1 Samuel 7:15). One of the main arguments presented by the book of Judges was that Israel needs to be faithful to God and needs a Godly king. In the book of Samuel, we see two kings: Saul and David. Based on 1 Samuel 9:2, we know that Saul was very handsome and looked, outwardly, like a king. Throughout Saul's reign, however, we find that he is not faithful to God. Next we have King David who has a heart that longs to seek and honor God (see 1 Samuel 16:7). This man is set up as the solution to the problem identified in Judges; this is the Godly king that Israel has needed. In Second Samuel, God makes a covenant with David which promises that one of David's seed will rule forever. This promise carries us through the New Testament where we see that Jesus is the fulfillment of this covenant (see Luke 1:32, Revelation 22:3, 22:16).
