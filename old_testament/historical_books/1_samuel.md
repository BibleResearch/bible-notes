# 1 Samuel

Before starting, it is important to recognize that the books we know as First and Second Samuel were one book in early manuscripts. In these notes, the two books will be treated as separate, but this distinction is artificial.

## Authorship and Audience
According to Jewish tradition, Samuel wrote First Samuel chapters one through twenty four while Gad and Nathan finished the rest of First Samuel and all of Second Samuel.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> The primary difficulty with this claim is that 1 Samuel 27:6 implies that the author (or editor) was writing during the time of the divided monarch. Thus, First and Second Samuel could not have been written in their final forms by Samuel, Nathan, or Gad because none of them lived during the time of the divided monarchy. It is certainly possible that the books we know as First and Second Samuel incorporated writings and accounts from Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, but the author remains unknown to us.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

## Date and Historical Context
Assuming this book was written during the time of the divided monarchy, it was probably written ca. **931â€“722 BC**.<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>

## Literary Context
The book of Samuel continues from Judges as the first, main character (Samuel) is a judge (see 1 Samuel 7:15). One of the main arguments presented by the book of Judges was that Israel needs to be faithful to God and needs a Godly king. In the book of Samuel, we see two kings: Saul and David. Based on 1 Samuel 9:2, we know that Saul was very handsome and looked, outwardly, like a king. Throughout Saul's reign, however, we find that he is not faithful to God. Next we have King David who has a heart that longs to seek and honor God (see 1 Samuel 16:7). This man is set up as the solution to the problem identified in Judges; this is the Godly king that Israel has needed. In Second Samuel, God makes a covenant with David which promises that one of David's seed will rule forever. This promise carries us through the New Testament where we see that Jesus is the fulfillment of this covenant (see Luke 1:32, Revelation 22:3, 22:16).

## Theological Themes
- **God gets Glory when He Reverses Situations and Uses Unexpected Means to Accomplish His Ends.** The primary theme of 1 Samuel is that God reverses situations so that He gets the glory. Hannah's prayer of thanksgiving in chapter two introduces and celebrates this fact. At God's command, "the bows of the mighty are shattered, but the feeble gird on strength. Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry cease to hunger" (1 Samuel 2:4-5). This theme is echoed throughout the rest of the book as God turns a Philistine victory into a curse (4:1 - 7:4), anoints an unlikely king (16), and uses David to kill Goliath (17).
- **God gets Glory when We Worship Him as He Demands.** God has every right to our worship and He demands it. God is glorified when we obey and worship Him. As Eli's sons (Eli and Phineas) do, disobeying God robs Him of the glory He deserves and turns that glory back to ourselves. This is important for understanding God's hatred of sin and disobedience. Sin is not a trivial matter because it robs God of the glory He deserves.
- **The Importance of the Heart.** Through the book of First Samuel, demonstrates the importance of the heart in worship. According to Samuel, God is looking for "man after His own heart" (1 Samuel 13:14). After rejecting Saul, God Himself says "man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart" (16:7). If our hearts are not right with God, we are unable to worship Him regardless of what 'good' actions we do externally. The story about the ark (4:1 - 7:4) is a great example that God looks at the heart and not only the external.

## Observations
- The name of one of Eli's sons is "**Phineas**" which is an ironic reference to the faithful priest in Numbers 25. Unlike the first Phineas, Eli's son is neither faithful nor jealous for God's glory; in fact, he robs God of the glory through his disregard for the sacrificial system (2:12-17).
- When we read of the remarkable friendship between David and Jonathan, keep in mind that Jonathan was the next in line for the throne as Saul's heir. In 1 Samuel 18:4, Jonathan representatively hands the kingdom over to David by giving David his robe and armor.
- - When Israel asks for a king in 1 Samuel 8, there are two major problems. First, Israel wants a king "like the other nations". The fact that Israel is trying to be "like the other nations" is a sign that they are probably not seeking to live as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Exodus 19:6). Second, there is an implicit assumption that having a king will alleviate the oppression they are facing from the nations around them. Israel thinks that if they have a king, they will no longer be oppressed. In reality, Israel is oppressed because they were not faithful to God (for example, see Joshua 23:6-13). Israel views a king as a way to get rid of the consequences of their sin without being faithful to God.
