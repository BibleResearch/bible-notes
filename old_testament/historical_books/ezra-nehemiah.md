# Ezra and Nehemiah

In the Hebrew Bible, Ezra and Nehemiah are one book. In this study, Ezra and Nehemiah are treated together as the narrative flows very nicely between the two books. I will refer to the combined book as "Ezra-Nehemiah".

## Authorship and Audience
As the name implies, the book of Ezra has been attributed to a priest and scribe named Ezra. Ezra enters in the scene in Ezra 7 and plays a crucial role through the rest of the book as well as the book of Nehemiah. According to both Jewish and Christian traditions, Ezra also wrote the book of Nehemiah. This argument is based on similarities between the books of [Ezra](ezra.html) and Nehemiah as well as the fact that the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) and [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) both mention that Ezra wrote the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. It is clear from reading Nehemiah, that Ezra used Nehemiah's personal records as a source for the account. This is why portions of the text (Nehemiah 1:1 – 7:5, 12:27–43, and 13:4–31) are in the first person. Given the focus on the reconstruction of the temple, Jerusalem, and reinstitution of the purity described in the law, Ezra-Nehemiah was written to the nation of Israel as she was seeking to reestablish her national identity.

## Date and Historical Context
The book of Ezra starts with a decree from [King Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) (Ezra 1:1-4) around 538/537 BC. Ezra records opposition faced by the reconstruction efforts as the project starts and restarts between 538 and 445 BC. Initially, a man named **Zerubbabel** is leading the reconstruction efforts (Ezra 1 - 6 ~ 538 - 458 BC). Ezra himself returned from Persia to Jerusalem in **458 BC** and would have finished writing the book in the years following this date. The date 458 BC assumes that the "Artaxerxes" referenced in 7:7 is [Artaxerxes I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_I_of_Persia) who began to reign in 465 BC. Israel had been in exile for many years and were finally returning to Israel and reinstituting the festivals and laws described in the Mosaic law.

The book of Nehemiah begins in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I's reign (ca 445 BC, see Nehemiah 1:2). The book of Nehemiah was written after Nehemiah had served as governor which was probably sometime between **430 and 410 BC**.

The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were likely compiled by Ezra after Nehemiah's second term as governor (around 430 BC, described in Nehemiah 13).

## Literary Context
Ezra 1:1-3a is the same as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. Thus, Ezra begins where 2 Chronicles ends. The book of Ezra details the return of Israel from exile which fulfills God's promises made in earlier books. Ezra-Nehemiah are also some of the last books to be written in the Old Testament canon. As such, they lay the foundation for the culture in which Jesus Christ appears.

## Timeline

For Ezra-Nehemiah, it is helpful to consider how the events described in the text fit on a timeline:

  - [586] Nebuchadnezzar II sacks Jerusalem and destroys the temple

...

## Outlines

### Simple Outline

For a simple outline, remember that there are three, primary characters: Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. We get to see both Ezra and Nehemiah twice. Zerubbabel rebuilds the temple. Nehemiah rebuilds Jerusalem (and sometimes confronts the people), and Ezra is always engaged in rebuilding the people and reestablishing God's law.

- Zerubbabel: Rebuilding the Temple (Ezra 1 - 6)
- Ezra: Rebuilding the People (Ezra 7 - *10*)
  - *Israel's failures (9 - 10)*
- Nehemiah: Rebuilding Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1 - 7)
- Ezra: Rebuilding the People (Nehemiah 8 - 10)
- Nehemiah: Rebuilding Jerusalem and People (Nehemiah 11 - *13*)
  - *Israel's failures (13)*

## Theological Theme
- **The exile is not over (spiritually speaking).** While Israel has physically returned from exile, the exile is not over spiritually. Ezra-Nehemiah demonstrates that the promises of a new heart, the Holy Spirit, and the prosperity attendant with a return from exile (see Deuteronomy 4:27-31, 29:22 - 30:10, Isaiah 43 - 44:5, Ezekiel 36:16-32) are not present. This means that Israel is still in exile. We had high hopes that things would be different after the exile, but in reality nothing has changed (see Ezra 9 and Nehemiah 13:26-28).
- **Mankind has a heart problem (spiritually speaking).** The theme noted in the previous point should draw our attention to the fact that Israel's problem is the inward sinfulness that is common to all men. Deuteronomy 4, 6, 10, and 30 make it clear that each Israelite must follow God with *all* of his/her heart. But this is not possible without God changing their hearts. Ezra-Nehemiah is a reminder that men are hopeless without the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. If anyone would have experienced a sufficiently traumatic event to draw them back to God, it was Israel. Yet, even under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah, Israel quickly returns to their old ways. There but for the grace of God go I.
- **God is the *only* one capable of saving Israel.** If the punishment of the exile didn't fix the problem and Israel's sinful hearts still remain, God is the only one who can save them.

## Observations
- Ezra 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26 are written in [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language). This is evidence that Ezra had access to official documents from the Persian king which would have been written in Aramaic.
- Ezra 1:1-3a are the same as 2 Chronicles 36:22-23. The literary implications of this are discussed [here](#literary-context). From an authorial and historical perspective, this implies that Ezra had access to the book of Chronicles or visa-versa (or, that Ezra is the author of both Chronicles and Ezra).
- Ezra 7:10 is a fantastic model for anyone aspiring to be a teacher. Learn it; live it; teach it.
- The [Elephantine Papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine_papyri#Jewish_temple_at_Elephantine) mentions Sanballat (who is also mentioned in Nehemiah 2:19) and Jehohanan (mentioned in Nehemiah 6:18 and 12:23).
