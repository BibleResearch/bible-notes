# Judges

## Authorship and Audience
The name of the author is not given in the text, but Talmudic tradition holds that **Samuel** the prophet wrote this book. This book was undoubtedly written to a Jewish audience, given the specificity of the geography and tribal details given.

## Date and Historical Context
Based on Judges 1:21, this book must have been written before David had taken Jerusalem. As such, it was likely written **before 1003 BC**.

## Literary Context
Judges is fascinating in its literary context because it picks up where Joshua left off with the people in the land having been tasked with serving God and Him alone (Joshua 22:5 and 24:14) so that God will continue to drive out the other nations in the land (Joshua 24:3-13). Judges documents their failures to be faithful to God and graphically demonstrates the need for a Godly king. Judges presents the lack of a king as a problem and the next book, Ruth, provides the solution (David). Looking further downstream in the Bible, the need for a Godly king established in Judges becomes one of the central themes in the historical narratives (Samuel through Chronicles), some of the psalms (e.g. Psalm 2 and 110), the gospel of Matthew, and Revelation. Israel needs a Godly King and He came as the man Jesus Christ.

## Theological Themes
- **The Need for a Godly King.** Introduced in the epilogue of this book, the refrain "there was no king in Israel" is repeated in 17:6, 18:1, 19:1, and 21:25. This phrase is introduced not only to diagnose the cause of the two stories in the epilogue, but also to describe the problem underlying all of Israel's history as recorded in the book of Judges and to present the need for a Godly king who is ultimately found in Jesus Christ.

## Observations/Notes
- There is a [chiastic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiastic_structure) of the Judges presented in the main section of the book (chapters 3:7 - 16). :

    ```
    A: Othniel: Marriage closely related to the story (1:13-15)
      B: Ehud: Story involves the fords of the Jordan (3:28)
        C: Deborah and Barak: Antagonist killed by a woman (4:21)
          D: Gideon: The people want him to be king (8:22-23)
        C`: Abimelech: Antagonist 'killed' by a woman (9:53-54)
      B`: Jephthah: Story involves the fords of the Jordan (12:5)
