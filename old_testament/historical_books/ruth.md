# Ruth

## Authorship and Audience
The name of the author is not given in the text, but Jewish tradition holds that **Samuel**, the prophet, wrote this book.

## Date and Historical Context
Based on Ruth 1:1, we know that this story took place during the time of the Judges and specifically during a time of famine. Scholars don't know when this famine occurred, so we can only say that the events described in this book likely occurred between **1300 and 1050 BC**.

## Literary Context
Ruth solves a problem demonstrated by the book of Judges; namely, Israel lacks a Godly king to lead and guide the people. The book of Judges ends with two horror stories that relate, even peripherally, to Bethlehem. Ruth is a third story that relates to Bethlehem (1:1), but is a positive story of hope. The story of Ruth describes how God was working during the same time as the Judges to provide a king for Israel. As described in the "Literary Context" section for the book of Joshua, the theme of kingship is one that runs throughout the books of historical narrative which follow Ruth (Samuel - Chronicles), the psalms, gospel of Matthew, and book of Revelation.
