# Zechariah ~ *“Yahweh Remembers”*


## Authorship
Likely **Zechariah** (see 1:1).  Based on the genealogy in 1:1, we know that Zechariah was a priest descended from Iddo (who is mentioned in Nehemiah 12:4 and 16).  We also know, based on the dates given in 1:1 and 1:7, that Zechariah was a contemporary of Haggai although Zechariah's ministry lasted longer than that of Haggai.


## Date and Context
Based on passages like Zechariah 1:1, 1:7, and 7:1, we know that Zechariah started prophesying in 520 B.C., the same year as Haggai, and kept prophesying until 518 BC.


## Theme(s)
- **God's Word is Certain and Lasting.**  One of the fundamental principles underlying the visions and prophecies in the book of Zechariah is that God's word will come to pass and will stand the tests of time.  It outlasts prophets, kings, and kingdoms and even those who would ignore or reject God's word are, in fact, fulfilling it.  This is made clear in the first six verses of Zechariah.  It is easy to read over these verses and wade into the challenges of understanding the visions, but it is critical to remember that all of these prophetic visions have significance because God's Word is lasting and is certain.

- **God's Reign is Certain and Will Be Lasting**  The book of Zechariah closes with a promise that God will one day be King "over all the earth" (14:9).  The whole book of Zechariah, while complex at points, all leads to the point in history when God asserts His authority and takes dominion of the earth.  Zechariah 9:10 also affirms this as the same King riding on a donkey rules "from sea to sea".

- **God's Lovingkindess is Certain and Lasting**  As I mentioned in the previous point, the book of Zechariah culminates with God exercising dominion over the earth.  In the process of getting to this point, we witness God's remarkable and lasting lovingkindness as He defends His people (14:3), pours out his Spirit upon "the House of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem" (12:10), gathers and restores His people (10:5-*12*), and allows nations to be called His people (2:11) (and these are just a few examples).  God's lovingkindness and grace have been and will continue to be poured out on His people in all ages.

- **Prosperity for God's People is Certain and Will Be Lasting**  Throughout many of the visions and the descriptions of what is to come, we are repeatedly reminded of the prosperity that will be brought to God's people.  In addition to receiving salvation and being gathered back to Jerusalem by God (8:7-8), the people of God are also promised peace, crops, and the fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant (that the whole world would be blessed by Abraham's seed) (8:9-23).

## Observations/Notes
  - If you are reading the book of Zechariah well, you will see numerous images and themes that overlap with other Old Testament prophecies (especially those of Daniel) and that are repeated in the book of Revelation.  Zechariah is an extremely important book to understand if we want to properly understand the book of Revelation.

  - Chapters 9 - 14 are very tough to understand, or at least to outline.  The first burden is especially difficult as it contains a description of the Messiah in Zechariah 9:9, fulfilled in Christ (Matthew 21:5), followed by a description of the peace brought by the Messiah in Zech. 9:10, which has not yet happened.
