# Amos ~ *“Burden Bearer”*


## Authorship
**Amos** (see 1:1).  'Hillbilly' character **from the Southern Kingdom (Judah)** who was **sent to the Northern Kingdom (Israel)** (see 7:14-15).


## Date and Context
The introduction of this book places the prophecy in the rule of Uzziah over Judah and that of **Jeroboam II** over Israel.  This would date the book to around **760 - 750 BC**.  In this time, Israel was enjoying **tremendous prosperity and wealth** as is alluded to in the book of Amos (references to summer houses and ivory in 3:15 and 6:4).


## Theme(s)
- **The Justice of God's Judgements.**  God's judgements against His people do not exceed the crime.  This book spends a lot of time describing the rebellion of Israel (along with other nations) against God.

## Observations/Notes
  - There are various 'structural markers' (repeated refrains) throughout this book.  These help communicate an idea through repetition and offer a way for listeners/readers to mentally structure the content.  In chapter one, the phrase *"For three transgressions... and for four..."* is used to begin each of the judgements on the seven nations.  In chapter three, the word *"citadel"* or *"strongholds"* is repeated.  In chapter four, the phrase *"'Yet you have not returned to Me', declares Yahweh."* is repeated.  In chapter five, Israel is repeatedly encouraged to *"seek"*.  The visions of chapter seven and eight are each introduced with the refrain *"Thus the Lord, Yahweh showed me and behold"*.
