# Nahum ~ *“Comfort” or "Consolation"*

## Authorship
**Nahum** (see 1:1).  We do not have any other biographical information about Nahum other than the fact that he was an Elkoshite (born in Elkosh).

## Date and Context
While we do not know the exact date that this book was written, we do have two events that give us a relatively small window in which the book must have been written.  Nahum 3:8 refers to "No-amon", the Egyptian city of Amon/Thebes, as already fallen.  Amon/Thebes did not fall until 663 B.C. which means that Nahum must have been written after 663 B.C.  Given the prophecy of this book centers around the destruction of Ninevah, the book must have been written before the city was destroyed by the Babylonians and Medes in 612 B.C.  For those who accept that Nahum was written between 663 and 612 B.C., there is much debate as to the exact date of this prophecy.  Some scholars have suggested that Nahum may be one of the "seers" who spoke to King Manasseh upon his return from Assyria (see 2 Chronicles 33:1-18 (vs. 18 specifically)).  This would put the writing of Nahum around 650 B.C.
