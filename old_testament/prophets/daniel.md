# Daniel


## Authorship and Audience
**Daniel** is the author of this book, as stated in Daniel 8:1 , 9:2, and 10:2.


## Date and Context
Daniel and his friends were likely taken in the **first conquest of Jerusalem** that occurred in **605 B.C.** (Dan. 1:1-7 and 6:*28*).  The events (not necessarily the events described in the visions) in the book took place between 605 and 530 B.C. and the bulk of the book of Daniel was likely finished by 535 B.C.  This meant that Daniel was involved in both the Babylonian and Persian governments.  In the midst of exile, Israel must have had a lot of questions... Is God powerful?  Is God sovereign?  Is God faithful?  What about all of God's promises?  Although indirectly, the book of Daniel answers these questions and gives hope to God's exiled people.


## Theme(s)
- **God is sovereign over ALL nations at ALL times.**  The book of Daniel highlights God's sovereign control over kingdoms, kings, and history itself (see Daniel 2:21a).

## Observations/Notes
  - From a literary perspective, the book of Daniel is masterfully written.  One of the most prominent evidences of this is found in Daniel 2.  In Daniel 2, we find that the king has had a dream of which he would like an interpretation.  To prove the legitimacy of the diviners and wise-men whom he asks, he refuses to tell them his dream so that anyone who wishes to provide an interpretation must first divine the dream itself.  This is an impossible task and, to make matters worse, the king soon orders that all who were asked for an interpretation of the mysterious dream be killed.  As the commander of the king's bodyguard was on his way to kill the wise-men, however, Daniel pleads with the king for more time, requests an answer from God, and receives revelation of the mystery (2:19).  At this point in the narrative, I believe the most natural question is: What is was the king's dream and what is its interpretation?  This is *not*, however, Daniel's *primary* point.  The primary point is not the revelation (that is, the content of the revelation), but the revealer (the source of the revelation).  Notice that the dream is revealed to Daniel in 2:19, but we do not get to hear what the dream was about until 2:31.  It is more important that we first hear Daniel's prayer, which spotlights God's sovereignty, wisdom, and knowledge and then hear Daniel's preface before the king, which underscores the fact that God is the source of this revelation and God's wisdom far surpasses any human wisdom.

  - Daniel 2:4 - 7:*28* are written in **Aramaic**.  At the time Daniel was written, Aramaic was the *lingua franca* that would have been spoken and understood by many in the Ancient Near East.  This highlights the fact that the events discussed are of international importance and should get international attention.

  - Daniel's vision encompass history from the current events of Daniel's day to the inter-testamental period to eschatology which has yet to happen.

  - In Daniel 12:2, we see one of the clearest descriptions in the Old Testament of the resurrection for either judgement or condemnation.
