# Ezekiel


## Authorship and Audience
The first four verses of the book indicate that **Ezekiel** is the author.  Ezekiel was a **Levite** who would normally have become a priest at age 30 (this is likely what the first verse of the book is referring to).  He was likely taken from Judah to Babylon in the **second wave of exiles** between 605 and 595 BC.


## Date and Context
Ezekiel started prophesying in **592 B.C.** and kept prophesying for **20 to 22 years** (until around 570 B.C.).  Many Israelites have been taken into exile at this point and are wondering about the promises of God.  Is God still faithful to His promises (Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants, for example)?  Does God lack the power to perform and execute His will and promises?


## Observations/Notes
  - Ezekiel is a very **chronological book**.  There are a lot of dates given throughout the book and the vast majority of them are given chronologically (which is relatively uncommon compared to other prophets).  This is especially true as the dates approach the last exile in 586 BC.
