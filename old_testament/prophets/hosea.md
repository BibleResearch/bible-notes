# Hosea ~ *“Salvation”*


## Authorship and Audience
Likely written by **Hosea** (see 1:1). Written to **Israel** (the **Northern Kingdom**) shortly after they had separated from Judah.


## Date and Context
This book was written shortly after **Israel** (the **Northern Kingdom**) had split from Judah and followed **Jeroboam** (vs. 1). This would have taken place around the **early 900s BC**.


## Theme(s)
- **God’s Love in Judgement.** One of the principal, theological themes of Hosea is God’s love in judgement. This is demonstrated by Hosea himself in marrying a prostitute and calling Israel to repent and return throughout the book (see the outline below). Put another way, this book answers the question: **“If God loves us, how can he judge us?”**. We will see that God has used and will use judgement as a way to bring His people back to Himself.
