# Zephaniah ~ *“Yahweh Hides/Protects”*


## Authorship
Likely **Zephaniah** (see 1:1).  From the short genealogical background of Zephaniah given in Zephaniah 1:1, we know that Zephaniah was **a descendant of King Hezekiah**.  This likely means that he was born into a relatively high social class.


## Date and Context
We know from Zephaniah 1:1 that Zephaniah's ministry took place during **Josiah's reign (640 - 609 B.C.)**.  Based on the reference to Nineveh as a city that "dwells securely" (Zephaniah 2:15), we can confidently say that Zephaniah's prophecy must have occurred before the fall of Nineveh 612 BC.  In 627 B.C., the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal died, which severely weakened Assyria.  It is possible that this prophecy occurred even before 627 while Assyria was still a very powerful nation.

## Observations/Notes
  - Both **Zephaniah 2:3** and **3:12** play on Zephaniah's name as both verses refer to the idea of hiding or seeking refuge in God.

  - God's warning about Nineveh in Zephaniah 2:13-15 would be carried out by the Babylonians and the Medes in **612 B.C.**, not too long after Zephaniah's ministry and possibly within Zephaniah's lifetime.
