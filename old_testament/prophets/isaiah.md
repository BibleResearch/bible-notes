# Isaiah ~ "Yah is salvation"

## Authorship and Audience
According to Isaiah 1:1, "Isaiah the son of Amoz" wrote this book. Based on 7:3, we know that he had a son and was presumably married. Isaiah was written primarily to Judah (the Southern Kingdom) as evidenced by the references to Judah's kings and the confrontation with Judah's idolatry.

## Date and Historical Context
Base on Isaiah 1:1, Isaiah was writing during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. As 'bookends' for the dating of the book, King Uzziah likely died around 740/739 BC and Judah was taken into captivity in 686 BC. Thus, the book was likely finished by 686 and parts of it were likely started before 740 BC. This was a tumultuous time in Judah's history as the Northern Kingdom would be taken into captivity by Assyria in 720 BC and the Southern Kingdom was heading into exile as well.

## Literary Context
Isaiah is quoted "over 65 times" in the New Testament which is "more than any other OT prophet".<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Jerome describes Isaiah as an 'evangelist' and notes  that the book deals with 'the mysteries of Christ and the Church'. TODO: find a footnote for this that is more reputable than http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_preface_isaiah.htm Isaiah is, indeed, a very forward-looking book as it presents what will happen to Israel (and the entire world) in the future.
