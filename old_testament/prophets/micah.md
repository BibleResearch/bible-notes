# Micah ~ *“Who is like Yahweh?”*

## Authorship
Almost certainly **Micah of Moresheth** (1:1 and 3:1-4).  We do not know where Moresheth is today, but Jeremiah 26:18 affirms that Micah was from Moresheth.  In fact, Jeremiah 26:16-19 includes a quote from Micah 3:12 used to defend what Jeremiah himself is prophesying.

## Date and Context
Micah prophesied around the same time as **Isaiah** (compare Micah 1:1 to Isaiah 1:1).  Micah's ministry likely began sometime around **740B.C.**, shortly after Isaiah's ministry had begun, and ended around **700B.C.**.  Unlike Isaiah, however, Micah's vision is not only about Jerusalem and the Southern kingdom, but it also has to do with Samaria and the Northern Kingdom.  This, combined with the dates of Micah's ministry, is particularly interesting because this means that **Israel, the Northern Kingdom, would have been exiled about half way through Micah's ministry** (the Northern Kingdom was exiled in 722 B.C.).
