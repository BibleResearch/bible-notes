# Ecclesiastes

> "Trying to grasp Ecclesiastes feels like trying to pin down a large resistant octopus"<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

Ecclesiastes is a difficult book. Don't be discouraged if you are having a hard time trying to figure out what this book is all about. You aren't the only one!

## Literary Context
As part of [Wisdom Literature](../), Ecclesiastes discusses topics like the meaning of life and what it means to live well in this world. Historically, this book ties into the reign of Solomon described in 1 Kings 2 - 11. The conclusions of the book emphasize God's judgement and hint at a resurrection. This theme is critical for the New Testament and ought to inform our thoughts on passages like 1 Corinthians 15 and 2 Thessalonians 1 (among many others).

## Outline
Before the official outline for the book, it is important to note that Ecclesiastes is a [frame narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story). This is a literary structure which contains a narrative within a narrative. Other examples of frame narratives include [Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein) (Mary Shelley's novel actually includes three layers of narrative) and [The Princess Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride). In Ecclesiastes, the outer narrative (the frame) refers to Qohelet in the third person. The inner narrative is Qohelet himself speaking. If one were to outline the outer and inner narratives of Ecclesiastes, it would look something like:

| Passage | Narrative Location |
|---|---|
| Ecclesiastes 1:1-11 | Outer |
| 1:12 - 7:26 | Inner |
| 7:27 | Outer |
| 7:28 - 12:7 | Inner |
| 12:8-*14* | Outer |

Now for an outline:

**0. Frame: Title [1:1]**

**I. Prologue [1:2-11]**

**II. Thesis [1:12-15]**

**III. Investigations [1:18 - 6:9]**

**IV. Results of Investigations [6:1- - 11:6]**

  - There is an interlude in 7:23-*29* where the narrative jumps back to the frame for 7:27

**V. Conclusion [11:7 - 12:8]**

**VI. Frame: Epilogue [12:9-*14*]**

## Observations
- Ecclesiastes is remarkably applicable for today. If you were to make a list of things in which Qohelet is trying to find purpose in meaning it would look something like:

  - wisdom
  - foolishness
  - sex
  - wine/alcohol
  - labor/money
  - power
  - status
  - accomplishment

  It is remarkable that we could have come up with this list simply by looking at the world around us. Ecclesiastes is remarkable, at times I would even venture to say eerily, applicable (e.g. TODO: ADD an example here).
- As surprising as this may sound, Ecclesiastes is a wonderful book for evangelism. I say this for two reasons. First, Ecclesiastes affirms the Bible's clear teaching that every human being has an innate desire for and knowledge of God. The very fact that the book of Ecclesiastes was written and that it corresponds to the reality we observe around us is evidence that human beings are trying to find meaning and purpose in the world around us. One can hardly read of the fact that God "sets eternity in their heart" and the frantic attempt to .

  The second reason I say that Ecclesiastes is useful for evangelism is that  because Ecclesiastes debunks the worldview of most of the people with whom we will interact in the western world. Consider this: it is very unlikely that anyone with whom you are speaking will ever have more money, sex, power, or accomplishments than Solomon. If Solomon found himself unsatisfied, how much more will anyone to whom you are speaking? Solomon's testimony, if we may call it that, in Ecclesiastes is a powerful example of a man who had it all and found it vanity. This quickly raises some questions. Every human has many desires so if those things won't satisfy, what will? This is where the restorative work of God in redemptive history comes front and center (see 2 Corinthians 5:11-21).

  I would be remiss if I did not mention that C.S. Lewis uses this logic in one of his books entitled *Mere Christianity*. In it, he argues that every desire has a satisfaction and, therefore, "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> The fact that we have desires which cannot be fulfilled "under the sun" is evidence that we are not designed only for life "under the sun".
- There is an interlude in 7:23-*29* where Qohelet recaps his purpose and where he is at in the process. The narrative also jumps back to the frame (as demonstrated by the use of the third person) in verse 27.
