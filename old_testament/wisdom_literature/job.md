# Job

## Authorship and Audience
The authorship of Job is highly debated. Some claim Job was the author, others Elihu, others say it must have been some by-stander. Ultimately, we really do not know as we have no explicit statement from the text and no conclusive evidence from history. In my opinion, there are a few points that make **Elihu** the most likely author. First, I do not believe the author was Job. If Job wrote the book after the events took place, this would mean that he would have been given revelation into the courtroom scenes in Job one and two. This would give him insight into the cause of his suffering which, while still not vindicating God's rightness in the matter, would have at least helped him understand the background to his suffering. For poetic reasons, I believe that he never got this understanding and never had the full story revealed to him in his lifetime. The second argument for Elihu as the author is that Elihu is the only one who interacts in the story who is not rebuked by God or Job (unlike Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job's wife). It appears that Elihu is right in most of what he has to say and, thus, would be a good candidate for recording the exchange.

No audience is explicitly given in the book of Job and any views on the audience of this book are closely tied to one's view of when the book was written. As I believe the book was likely written during the time of the Patriarchs, I believe this book *may* have been shared with the patriarchs themselves or the early nation of Israel. This is largely based on the fact that Elihu is called a "Buzite" (Job 32:6) and Buz is mentioned in Genesis 22:20-21 as one of Abraham's nephews). As mentioned, the audience is largely dictated by the date when the book was written and that is a matter of great debate with no explicit statements in the text.

## Date and Context
One of the interesting things about the book of Job is that it is the book that probably has the widest possible date range suggested by scholars. Some suggest it was written as late as after the exile, during the fifth century BC (499 - 400 B.C.) while others propose it was written as early as the times of the Patriarchs (the times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob described in Genesis). I argue that the book of Job was written earlier (no later than the time of Moses) and probably during the time of the Patriarchs. This argument is supported by the claim that Job lived 140 years *after* the events described in the book of Job (see Job 42:16), the language used (for example, the use of the word "Eloah" and "El" for God), and Job's role as a 'priestly' intercessor in Job 42:7-10 (which is similar to Abraham in Genesis 20:17).

## Theological Theme(s)
- **God is the Source of Wisdom** Throughout the various dialogs and responses in this book (which make up chapters 3 - 42:6), the fundamental question is: 'How do you know?'. When Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar attempt to defend God's actions, we ought to be asking ourselves how they know the position they are defending to be true. For example, in Job 4:7 Eliphaz opens with the rhetorical questions: "who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?". This statement is one of many that summarizes the position of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. The immediate question ought to be: "How do you know this is true?" (hint: Eliphaz gives us some details when he begins the next verse with "According to what I have seen..."). The book of Job is not just about *what* is being said, but also *on what grounds* it is being said; that is, epistemology is central to the book of Job. How can man know what God is doing? How can man know if God is right? When it comes to questions of who God is and what he is doing/will do, we inherently have very little insight and need knowledge from something outside of ourselves. This is the basis of **divine revelation** as an epistemology. As Job notes in **Job 28**, God as the source of all wisdom and, thus, the source from which our understanding must be derived. The book of Job establishes and really introduces the importance of revelation from God.

**I. Dialog Between Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job  [3 - 27]**

  - *Note:* There is a detailed summary of the dialog between Job and his friends [here](old_testament/wisdom_literature/job_summary.md).
  - *Note:* **TRP** mentioned below stands for the **"Temporal Response Principle"** which encapsulates the fundamental argument presented by Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. This principle states that God will (and even must) respond with punishment in this world for those who do evil. It also includes the converse: that God will respond with blessings in this world for those who do good.
