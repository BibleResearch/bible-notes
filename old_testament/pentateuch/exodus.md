# Exodus

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details.

## Date and Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Theme(s)
- **God as Powerful, Liberating King.** In the book of Exodus, especially in the first half, we see God as a King who doing battle with Pharaoh and the Egyptian Gods for the sake of His people. For example, in Exodus 12:12 God describes the killing of all the firstborn in Egypt as a judgement "against all the gods of Egypt" (see also Numbers 33:4). In Exodus 3:20-22, God promises Moses that Israel will "plunder" the Egyptians as they leave Egypt (which comes true in 12:35-36). In Exodus 5:1-2, Pharaoh refuses to recognize Yahweh's authority and let His people go free. The first portion of the book of Exodus is presented as a war between two kings (God and Pharaoh). God is defending His people because they are considered His firstborn son (see 4:21-23) and He is working to fulfill the promises He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see 6:7-8).
- **Israel's Inability to Keep a Covenant with God.** In chapter twenty four of this book, Israel ratifies a covenant with God (see Exodus 24:7-8). After Moses goes back up onto Mount Sinai for forty days to receive the plans for the tabernacle, the people violate the second commandment by creating an idol to represent God. Only forty days and the people are breaking the second commandment! One of the themes running through this book is Israel's inability to keep any covenant relationship with God. Even after seeing God's mighty salvation from Egypt and in the crossing of the Red Sea, Israel goes from singing God's praises (15:1-21) to complaining (15:22-27) at the drop of a hat. This is graphic testimony to the depths of man's sinfulness and inability to faithfully follow God of ourselves.

## Observations/Notes

- When we consider the depth and speed of Israel's changes from worship to sin, let us not think for a second that we are exempt from the same exact behavior. As Israel did, so would we have done and so would we be doing still but for the grace of God. Any faithfulness in us is only present because God is at work in us (see Philippians 2:12-13).
- Israel's inability to keep a covenant with God lays the groundwork for the book of **Leviticus** which establishes how a holy God can live in the midst of this people without killing them.
- In Exodus 34:11-17, God warns Moses about the dangers of idolatry which Israel will face when they enter the promised land. In this passage, God establishes that to worship the idols of those living in the promised land is to "play the harlot with their gods". In other words, following any other God but the true One is spiritual adultery. Sin, especially that of idolatry, really is a big deal. Take a moment to consider the fact that we are not exempt from idolatry even though very few of us would consider worshiping a golden calf. Idolatry doesn't require a golden calf. As Paul says in Colossians 3:5, "Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and **greed, which amounts to idolatry**." (emphasis is mine). Greed for money, power, sex, fame, you-name-it *is* idolatry. You are no longer worshiping the true God who is worthy of our worship, but are committing adultery with gods of your own making.
