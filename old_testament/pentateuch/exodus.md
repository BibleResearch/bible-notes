# Exodus

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details.

## Date and Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Theological Theme(s)
- **God as Powerful, Liberating King.** In the book of Exodus, especially in the first half, we see God as a King who doing battle with Pharaoh and the Egyptian Gods for the sake of His people. For example, in Exodus 12:12 God describes the killing of all the firstborn in Egypt as a judgement "against all the gods of Egypt" (see also Numbers 33:4). In Exodus 3:20-22, God promises Moses that Israel will "plunder" the Egyptians as they leave Egypt (which comes true in 12:35-36). In Exodus 5:1-2, Pharaoh refuses to recognize Yahweh's authority and let His people go free. The first portion of the book of Exodus is presented as a war between two kings (God and Pharaoh). God is defending His people because, according to Exodus 4:21-23, they are considered His son, His firstborn and He is working to fulfill the promises He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see Exodus 6:7-8).

## Observations/Notes
  - Israel does not get a good start at keeping the covenant they have with God. Literally forty days after ratifying the covenant with God in chapter 24, they are breaking the first commandment by creating an idol. This demonstrates the propensity of the people of Israel (and all people) toward sin and lays the groundwork for the book of Leviticus which clarifies how a holy God can live in the midst of this people without killing them.
  - In Exodus 34:11-17, we get see God Himself describe the sin of idolatry. The phrase He uses, in 34:15, is "play the harlot with their gods". In other words, following any other God but the true One is spiritual adultery. Sin, especially that of idolatry, really is a big deal. Also consider that idolatry in our day doesn't require a golden calf. As Paul says in Colossians 3:5, "Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and **greed, which amounts to idolatry**." (emphasis is mine).
