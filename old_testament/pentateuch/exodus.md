# Exodus

## Theological Theme(s)
- **God claims Israel as His People.** Although we have traced the development of the line of Israel in Genesis, it is not until the book of Exodus that God officially claims Israel as His own and forms a covenant with her. Exodus 1 through 15:21 detail God's liberation and defense of his people and present it as a war between Pharaoh and God. In Exodus 4:22-23, we see that God is treating Israel as His own, firstborn child.
- **How can a Holy God relate to an Unholy People?** From Exodus 15:22 through the end of the book, Israel has been liberated from Egypt by God and a question quickly arises. If Israel is unfaithful, how can God (who is holy) dwell with this people (who are unholy)? In Exodus 15:22 - 34, God's standards are laid out and we clearly see that Israel will be unfaithful to God. In fact, Israel's quickness to be unfaithful as described in Exodus is truly stunning as demonstrated by the golden calf in chapter thirty two and Israel's quickness to complain in chapter fifteen. Exodus begins to lay the groundwork for how the holy and faithful God will relate to His unholy and unfaithful people.
