# Exodus

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details.

## Date and Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Theme(s)
- **God as Powerful, Liberating King.** In the book of Exodus, especially in the first half, we see God as a King who doing battle with Pharaoh and the Egyptian Gods for the sake of His people. For example, in Exodus 12:12 God describes the killing of all the firstborn in Egypt as a judgement "against all the gods of Egypt" (see also Numbers 33:4). In Exodus 3:20-22, God promises Moses that Israel will "plunder" the Egyptians as they leave Egypt (which comes true in 12:35-36). In Exodus 5:1-2, Pharaoh refuses to recognize Yahweh's authority and let His people go free. The first portion of the book of Exodus is presented as a war between two kings (God and Pharaoh). God is defending His people because, according to Exodus 4:21-23, they are considered His son, His firstborn and He is working to fulfill the promises He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see Exodus 6:7-8).
- **Israel's Inability to Keep a Covenant with God.** In chapter twenty four of this book, Israel ratifies a covenant with God (see Exodus 24:7-8). After Moses goes back up onto Mount Sinai for forty days to receive the plans for the tabernacle, the people violate the first commandment by creating an idol to represent God. Only forty days and the people are breaking the very first commandment! One of the themes running through this book is Israel's inability to keep any covenant relationship with God. Israel goes from singing God's praises (15:1-21) to complaining (15:22-27) at the drop of a hat which is a testament to the depth of man's sinfulness.

## Observations/Notes

- When we consider the depth and speed of Israel's changes from worship to sin, let us not think for a second that we are exempt from the same exact behavior. As Israel did, so would we have done and so would we be doing still but for the grace of God.
- Israel's inability to keep a covenant with God lays the groundwork for the book of Leviticus which establishes how a holy God can live in the midst of this people without killing them.
- In Exodus 34:11-17, we get see God Himself describe the sin of idolatry. The phrase He uses, in 34:15, is "play the harlot with their gods". In other words, following any other God but the true One is spiritual adultery. Sin, especially that of idolatry, really is a big deal. Also consider that idolatry in our day doesn't require a golden calf. As Paul says in Colossians 3:5, "Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and **greed, which amounts to idolatry**." (emphasis is mine).
