# Leviticus

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details. This book was designed to go sometimes to Israel (e.g. Leviticus 1:2) and sometimes to the Aaron's sons who would become priests (e.g. 21:1 and 22:2).

## Date and Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Theological Theme(s)
- **The Need for Atonement.** The word "atonement" is used [forty nine](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=NASB&quicksearch=atonement&begin=3&end=3) times in the book of Leviticus. Building off of Exodus where we find that God is dwelling with Israel, the repeated use of the word "atonement" in Leviticus drives home the fact that atonement between God and man is essential (refer to the "Observations/Notes" section below for a discussion of what atonement means).
- **The Means of Atonement.** Leviticus provides the means by which Israel can atone for their sins: the life of an animal. Leviticus 17:11 makes it clear that the taking of a life is the appropriate and accepted way to atone for sin.
- **The Cost of Atonement.** The sacrificial system demonstrates the cost required to atone for sin. Every sin required a sin (or guilt) offering and there were even sacrifices to cover unknown and unconfessed sins. It is costly for a sinful people to be reconciled to a holy God.

## Observations/Notes
  - Atonement, in the Biblical sense, can be defined as:

    > A reparation of the relationship between God and man through the life of a sacrifice.
  - There is a good outline of the five sacrifices described in Leviticus 1 - 7 [here](https://rightlydividedbible.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/otsacrifices.png)†.
  - When reading the book of Leviticus, the words "clean" and "unclean" should jump off of the page. The word "unclean" is used [ninety one](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=NASB&quicksearch=unclean&begin=3&end=3) times in this book (in the NASB). God defines what is clean and what is unclean as well as how one passes from clean to unclean and visa-versa.
