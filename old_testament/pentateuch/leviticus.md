# Leviticus

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details. This book was designed to go sometimes to Israel (e.g. Leviticus 1:2) and sometimes to the Aaron's sons who would become priests (e.g. 21:1 and 22:2).

## Date and Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Theological Theme(s)
- **Clean and Unclean.** When reading the book of Leviticus, the words "clean" and "unclean" should jump off of the page. The word "unclean" is used [ninety one](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=NASB&quicksearch=unclean&begin=3&end=3) times in this book (in the NASB). God defines what is clean and what is unclean as well as how one passes from clean to unclean and visa-versa.
- **The Need for and Means of Atonement.** In the NASB Bible, the word "atonement" is used eighty times in the Old Testament. [Forty nine](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=NASB&quicksearch=atonement&begin=3&end=3) of those uses occur in the book of Leviticus. Atonement, in the Biblical sense, can be defined as:

> A reparation of the relationship between God and man through the life of a sacrifice.

 The emphasis on the word "atonement" in Leviticus reminds us of the need for atonement between a Holy God and a sinful Israel. The sacrificial system laid out in Leviticus provides the means of atonement by officially establishing that atonement must be secured by taking a life (see Leviticus 17:11).
