# Deuteronomy

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details.

## Date and Historical Context
According to Deuteronomy 1:1, Deuteronomy is a sermon given by Moses on the plains of Moab opposite the promised land. The first generation of Israelites who had not believe God had largely died off (see Numbers 14:28-31) and the next generation was on the brink of the promised land.

## Literary Context
At the end of the book of Numbers, the second generation of Israel from Egypt had was approaching the promised land and received some instructions on how what to do once they had entered into the land. Deuteronomy is Moses' last words to the people of Israel in which he "expound[s] the law" (see 1:5). This books serves as the conclusion, and in some ways a summary and climax, of Genesis through Numbers. The promises of God are starting to come true and this is an exciting time in Israel's history.

Although every book in the Bible is important, Deuteronomy is one of the most important (and ironically most frequently misunderstood) books in the Bible. In it we find the theology that guides the rest of the entire Bible. Deuteronomy describes why Israel does what she does in the subsequent books of Joshua and Judges. Deuteronomy provides guidance for the age in which there are kings over Israel. Deuteronomy predicts the exile and restoration. In it Moses also refers to another prophet like himself who will come (18:18). It defines what it means to love God (6:5) and how this works itself out in human relationships. Deuteronomy is a rich and provocative book and it is critical that we understand it if we are to understand the rest of the Bible.
