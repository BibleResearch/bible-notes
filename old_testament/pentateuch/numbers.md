# Numbers

## Authorship and Audience
According to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), **Moses** wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for more details.

## Date and Historical Context
Assuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for [Genesis](genesis.html) for a discussion of when this may have occurred.

## Literary Context
The book of Numbers is important as it describes what transpired between Moses receiving the law on Mount Sinai and Israel standing on the border of the promised land forty years later. The book of Numbers will show that the people are not faithful to God which sets up for Deuteronomy where we see that Israel *cannot* be faithful because they have sinful hearts.

## Theme
- **Faithfulness and Unfaithfulness.** The major theme of the book of Numbers is a contrast between faithfulness and unfaithfulness. For the most part, Israel is resolutely unfaithful to God, yet God remains unwaveringly faithful to His promises.
